# Math For Data Science.

Remarks here are personal and this is just for practice purposes only. Equations may seem erratic at places, as LATEX syntaxes are used to separate the lines. Works better on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Lessons here are from the book titled:

  ### Important notes:
  ___

* Chapters are way too long, take your time.
* This book extensively uses python's library [Sympy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) .
* You might be tempted to skip over the details covered in this book, the sort of "direct attempt" at the algorithms and very long, exhaustive, scary looking lines of codes, don't. Because it helps your brain wiring to these stuff. No matter how simple you may think of an algorithm like Linear Regression, even so it takes time for you to be skeptical about the results and coming up with your own hypotheses. 
* There is no shortcut, but it may be good to copy and run the codes in the chapters than having to hand code them. I'll advise against doing that with the exercises though.
